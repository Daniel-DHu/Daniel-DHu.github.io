<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a PhD student, candidate in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), studenting in the [Human-Oriented Intelligent Systems Lab (HOIS)](https://www.chaohuang.net/), and my supervisor is Dr. Chao Huang. 

In my research, I focus on the intersection between intelligent vehicles / mobile robot and machine learning, with the aim of developing algorithms that can endow agent safer, more efficient and economical. In particular, my research interests include deep learning, reinforcement learning and control theory with the application to decision-making, planning, prediction and energy optimization.
